Note: if something redirects automatically back to the mainpage, check other pages like view comments to see if the task was successful.  
If an attempt to click on something on the mainpage fails, then it is probably our project not letting you do the command for a reason. For instance, we do not let users edit or delete other users' stories.


Creative Portion


•We added a like function to stories. Essentially, users can like and unlike any stories that they so choose. Users can like a story at most once.  

•We added a segment where users can view the profile of all the registered users. This includes viewing their stories, comments, and stories they have liked.

•Back buttons were created for certain pages for convenience. 

•Registered users can edit story title and story link.

•Users can view their own comments. (For us, this page actually leads to the editing and deleting of a user’s own comments, but technically this page isn’t required so we put it as part of our creative portion)
