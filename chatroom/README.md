Creative Portion:
- don't allow messages containing certain curse words (like the f word) to go through in the chat

- an option to disconnect a user if they're being particularly bad (erase their name from all chatrooms, and freeze that user's screen so that they cannot chat/enter rooms at all)

- an option for a creator of a room to change the name of a chatroom

- an option for a creator of a room to remove a chatroom


Note: we used some code from this tutorial: http://psitsmike.com/2011/10/node-js-and-socket-io-multiroom-chat-tutorial/. Whenever we took code from it to use, we cited it in our code for any block we used it from, and I hope the amount we used isn't too much. Based on the academic integrity policy, I hope our citations are okay.
